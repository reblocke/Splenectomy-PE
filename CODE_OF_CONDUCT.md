# Code of Conduct

We are committed to a welcoming, safe, and professional environment for everyone.

## Our pledge
We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and scientific integrity.

Unacceptable behaviors include:
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Gratuitous or sexualized language or imagery.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, or personal attacks.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.

## Scope
This Code applies within project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. If unacceptable behavior occurs, maintainers may take appropriate action, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from project spaces.

## Reporting
If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior:
- Open an issue, or
- Contact the maintainers privately (via GitHub profile).

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
This policy is inspired by widely used community codes of conduct (e.g., Contributor Covenant v2.1) and adapted for a research‑software context.
